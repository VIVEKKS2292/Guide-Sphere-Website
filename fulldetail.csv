Massive new React ""expansion pack"" covers: React basics, JSX, props, state, Vite, MaterialUI, hooks, useEffect, React design patterns, and more.

Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.  This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:

This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.

92% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.

The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.  This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.

Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!

We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.

The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.

You get to meet my cats and chickens!

When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the ""beginner friendly"" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.

Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

HTML5

CSS3

Flexbox

Responsive Design

JavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)

Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.

AJAX and single page apps

Bootstrap 4 and 5

ReactJS

SemanticUI

Bulma CSS Framework

DOM Manipulation

Unix(Command Line) Commands

NodeJS

NPM

ExpressJS

Templating

Cloud Databases

Image Upload and Storage

Maps and Geocoding

This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of ""watch as I code"" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:


Lectures

Code-Alongs

Projects

Exercises

Research Assignments

Slides

Downloads

""Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer"" — Carson Bartholomew




JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.

That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!




Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?

This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.

You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.

You will become ready to continue learning advanced front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte.

You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need in your developer job.

And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!

But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's ""The Complete JavaScript Course"". In fact, it's like many courses in one! But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course. That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.

By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.




Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?

My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 850,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.

I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.




So what exactly is covered in the course?

Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns

Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more

Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining, and more

How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.

Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.

Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. [This is like a small standalone course]

Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]

Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel, Babel, and ES6 modules

Check out the course curriculum for an even more detailed overview of the content :)




This is what's also included in the package:

Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business learners)

This course starts from scratch, you neither need to know Angular 1 nor Angular 2!

From Setup to Deployment, this course covers it all! You'll learn all about Components, Directives, Services, Forms, Http Access, Authentication, Optimizing an Angular App with Modules and Offline Compilation and much more - and in the end: You'll learn how to deploy an application!

But that's not all! This course will also show you how to use the Angular CLI and feature a complete project, which allows you to practice the things learned throughout the course!

And if you do get stuck, you benefit from an extremely fast and friendly support - both via direct messaging or discussion. You have my word! ;-)

Angular is one of the most modern, performance-efficient and powerful frontend frameworks you can learn as of today. It allows you to build great web apps which offer awesome user experiences! Learn all the fundamentals you need to know to get started developing Angular applications right away.

Hear what my students have to say

""Absolutely fantastic tutorial series. I cannot thank you enough. The quality is first class and your presentational skills are second to none. Keep up this excellent work. You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse""

""The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!""

""As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.""

This Course uses TypeScript

TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular apps. Check out the free videos for more information.

TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.

Why Angular?

Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.

Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.

Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular (= Angular 2+) you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.

Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular applications

This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a lot of deep dives and each section is backed up with a real project. All examples showcase the features Angular offers and how to apply them correctly.

Specifically you will learn:

Which architecture Angular uses

How to use TypeScript to write Angular applications

All about directives and components, including the creation of custom directives/ components

How databinding works

All about routing and handling navigation

What pipes are and how to use them

How to send HTTP requests (e.g. to REST APIs)

What dependency injection is and how to use it

How to use modules in Angular

How to optimize your (bigger) Angular applications

An introduction to NgRx and complex state management

We will build a major project in this course so that you can practice all concepts

And so much more!

The Problem

Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.     

However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.    

And how can you do that?  

Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)   

Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture  

The Solution   

Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.   

Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out  

Mathematics  

Statistics   

Python   

Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python   

Data Visualization  

Machine Learning  

Deep Learning  

Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.   

So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2024.   

We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field – having all the necessary resources in one place.  

Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).   

The Skills

   1. Intro to Data and Data Science

Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?     

Why learn it? As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.  

   2. Mathematics 

Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.   

We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.   

Why learn it?  

Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.

   3. Statistics 

You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.  

Why learn it?  

This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.

   4. Python

Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.

Why learn it?   

When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language.  

   5. Tableau

Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.

Why learn it?   

A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers.  

   6. Advanced Statistics 

Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.  

Why learn it?  

Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section.  

   7. Machine Learning 

The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data scientist from a data analyst. This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.  

Why learn it?   

Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for you to control the machines.  

**What you get**

A $1250 data science training program   

Active Q&A support  

All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist  

A community of data science learners  

A certificate of completion   

Access to future updates  

Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job   

You will become a data scientist from scratch   We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee. No risk for you. The content of the course is excellent, and this is a no-brainer for us, as we are certain you will love it.

Open a new browser tab, type in www.omnifood.dev, and take a look around. I will wait here...

...

Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?

Well, I'm here to teach you HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw, step-by-step.

So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.

But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project.




So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:

The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (www.omnifood.dev). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!

How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).

How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs

How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)

How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching

How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons

Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools

Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today!

Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading...




[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?

Building websites allows you to do fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well. Web development is one of the most future-proof and highest-paying industries in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!

But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!

This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an all-in-one package that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.




[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?

Reason #1: The course is completely project-based

Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by building actual projects! In the final project (www.omnifood.dev), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a fictional company that I made up just for the course.




Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code

Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire 7-step process of building and launching our website project.

So the huge Omnifood project will teach you real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.

On top of that, this course has a huge focus on beautiful design. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.




Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you

With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be quite easy and fun to learn. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.

My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.

Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and designed the ideal course curriculum for every type of student. It's a unique blend of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!




[03] Why is this course so long?

Reason #1: I take time to explain every single concept that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (this is a course, not a tutorial)

Reason #2: I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!

Reason #3: There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually assimilate and practice what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills




[04] Here is what's also included in the package:

Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)

Professional English captions (not the auto-generated ones)

Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section

Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)

Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years

Free support in the course Q&A

10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)




[05] This course is for you if...

... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.

... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.

... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).

Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.

- or just learn Python to be able to create your own Python apps quickly.

…then you need a solid foundation in Python programming. And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.

This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.

The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.

And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.

By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.

Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.

“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria

“I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin

“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen

And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.

Will this course give you core python skills?

Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.

Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?

No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.

Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.

This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.

By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above.

Why should you take this course?

There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.

You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.

As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand. 

And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.

This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.

Here’s just some of what you’ll learn

(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)

·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating

·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.

·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.

·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.

·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  IntelliJ has both a FREE and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.

(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).

Does the course get updated?

It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released every day, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.

A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.

For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.

We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.

What if you have questions?

As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all).

This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.

That’s just one reason why Tim was voted top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  

Student Quote: “Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger

There’s no risk either!

This course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.

You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…

You literally can’t lose.

Don't just take my word for it, see what my past students had to say about the course:

""You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it, as it is the BEST Swift programming class I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store."" - Ian Hopjins

""SO GOOD!!! Retention rate is incredible because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5"" - Muhammad Ibrahim

""Angela is a spectacular teacher!"" - Marco Zanirato

""This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I realized how good this course was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept."" - Marc

""Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but Angela made me a pro in weeks."" - Burak Tunçbilek

""IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of this course is built to make you learn, not just watch and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!"" - Eduard Khachian

Are you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:

I have revamped my expectation for what a 5 star course should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela! - Alberto L

""I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, deep and clear."" - Žan Fras

""I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the best explanation on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable."" - Bryan Pukanda

""I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which i did not want it to end. It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course."" - Arun Lakhera

""I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say ""just do this. You will see why later."" She goes into the reason for doing something before doing it."" - Clyde Addison

Do you have some experience developing iOS apps and wonder if this course is for you? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:

""This is the best-organized course for starting Swift that I've seen. The course is excellent for teaching Swift programming including vital information using Xcode, Github, Cocoapods, Stack Overflow, Alamofire, Firebase, REST APIs and all the services commonly used by app developers. They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly. Wish I had this course a year ago but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone's instructional videos, seriously. :)"" - Marcy Vernon

""Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming. I've been coding for years and taken many programming related classes on Udemy and this is def. one of the best. The instructor walks you through all the in's and out's of developing apps for the iOS platform. Top Shelf A++ class."" - Mirko Cukich

Compared to other Spring Boot/Hibernate courses

This course is fully up to date and covers the latest versions of Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 and Hibernate 6. The course also includes new content on Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST and Thymeleaf.

Beware of other Udemy Spring/Hibernate courses. Most of them are outdated and use old versions of Spring and Hibernate. Don’t waste your time or money on learning outdated technology.

Also, I create all of the code from scratch in this course. Beware of other courses, those instructors simply copy/paste from their github repo or they use pre-written code. Their approach is not ideal for real-time learning.

Take my course where I show you how to create all of the code from scratch. You can type the code along with me in the videos, which is the best way to learn.

I am a very responsive instructor and I am available to answer your questions and help you work through any problems.

Finally, all source code is provided with the course along with setup instructions.




Student Reviews Prove This Course's Worth

Those who have reviewed the course have pointed out that the instruction is clear and easy to follow, as well as thorough and highly informative.

Many students had also taken other Spring Boot and Hibernate courses in the past, only to find that this Spring Boot and Hibernate course was their favorite. They enjoyed the structure of the content and the high quality audio/video.

You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.

Sound familiar?

I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.

The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.

The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.

From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.

You’ll be building four projects:

1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet

2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs

3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication

4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion

By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.

When learning, learn the latest.

I work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with the latest Node.js version.

You’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.

Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.

You can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.

There’s no better time to learn Node.

According to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.

You might get stuck. But I’m here to help.

There’s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.

I’m in the Q&A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.

Don’t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.

""This is amazing. What's even better is the instructor answered all the questions I asked."" - Pak Chu

""The real value in this course is Andrew; he is not just a great teacher, but also he's quick to answer questions and provide feedback."" - Nick Hester

C++14 and C++17 covered.  C++20 info see below.,Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy,4.6,English,Last updated 1/2024,,"Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers?  C++

Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview?  C++ 

Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?  C++

Why you should learn C++

Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years. 

Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.

There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!

Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.

Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.

Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?

If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.

But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++  is because it is so powerful!

What do I mean by powerful?

C++ is super fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.

It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.

C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.

That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.

Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.

How can a beginner learn C++?

Find a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.

Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses.  He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.

So not only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught at university level for many years.

As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.

Which version of C++ should I learn?

C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years.  It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.

Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17).  

Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.

What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?

This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20. 

C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.    So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it. 

It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.

What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course.

It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.

And even if you really do want to learn C++20,  the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.

If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.

Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!

Is C++ difficult to learn?

With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.

There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.

But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that's what this course is all about.

What will I learn in this course?

The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.

Key topics covered include.

* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion
* Performing calculations and displaying results
* Functions
* Pointers
* Using existing classes and creating objects
* Creating your own classes
* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector
* Constructors and Destructors
* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment 
* How to overload operators
* Using inheritance and class hierarchies
* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding 
* Using smart pointers
* Using stream I/O
* An introduction to the C++ STL
* An introduction to Exception Handling
* And much more.


How is this C++ course different from other courses?

You will learn Modern C++, for one.  Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.  If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.

The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.

You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as your instructor Frank has.

What do I get out of learning C++?

More career options for one!  C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development.    It's also heavily used in embedded applications.  Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!

No matter at which metric you look at (Google Trends, Github Stars, Tweets ...) - VueJS is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript frameworks - it simply is amazing!

This bestselling Udemy course teaches the latest version of Vue (Vue.js 3) from the ground up and in great detail. We'll cover all the core basics but we'll not stop thereafter - this course also dives into advanced concepts like the Composition API introduced with Vue 3.

Frontend frameworks like Vue JS are extremely popular because they give us this reactive, great user experience we know from mobile apps - but now in the browser! No wonder that jobs requiring frontend framework skills like VueJS are amongst the best paid ones in the industry!

You may know Angular 2+ and ReactJS, well, VueJS combines the best of both frameworks and makes building anything from small widgets to big, enterprise-level apps a breeze and a whole lot of fun!

And if you don't know the two mentioned frameworks: That's fine, too, this course does not expect any knowledge of any other frontend framework - you will learn it all throughout this Course!

This course covers it all!

We'll start at the very basics, what Vue.js is and how it works before we move on to more complex and advanced topics but I'll be honest: It's too much to fit it all into one sentence, so here's what you'll learn in this Course:

What is VueJS and Why would you use it?

The Basics (including the basic Syntax, Understanding Templates and much more!)

How to Output Reactive Data & Listen to Events

Interacting with DOM (Rendering Lists, Conditionally attaching/ detaching Elements ...)

Setting up a Development Environment and Workflow

Using Components (and what Components are to begin with)

A Deep Dive Look Behind the Scenes of Vue

Binding to Form Inputs

Sending Http Requests to Backend APIs

Authentication & Vue

How to make your App more Beautiful with Animations and Transitions

How to create an awesome Single-Page-Application (SPA) with Routing

How to improve State Management by using Vuex

How to Deploy the App

And much more!

All these topics are taught with real examples and demo projects. This course is full of exercises, challenges and bigger courser projects that allow you to practice what you learned.

Along with many other smaller projects, we will build a couple of bigger main projects:

The ""Monster Slayer"" Game - a game running in the browser, 100% powered by Vue

The ""Learning Resource Manager"" - a web app that allows you to manage (add, delete, list) your favorite learning resources

The ""Find a Coach"" app - a web app that allows you to sign up / login, register as a coach, list and filter available coaches and send messages to coaches

Is this course for you?

Now that you know what this course is about, let's see if this course is for you!

CI+CD Workflows? You will learn it.  AWS Deployment? Included.  Kubernetes in Production? Of course!

This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy any web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.




Docker from Scratch!

In this course you'll learn Docker from absolute fundamentals, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as ""What is a container?"" and ""How does a container work?"".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a deep dive on the inner workings of containers, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications. 




CI + CD Pipelines

Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that automatically deploys your code every time you push your latest changes to Github!




Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!

After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container deployments on Amazon Web Services.  You will construct a multi-container application utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).




Kubernetes!

Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster - this course doesn't have any of those annoying ""don't do this in production"" comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to set up HTTPS on Kubernetes, which is harder than it sounds!




Here's what you'll do:

Learn Docker from scratch, no previous experience required

Build your own custom images tailored to your applications

Master the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers

Understand how Docker works behind the scenes, and what a container is

Build a CI + CD pipeline from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS

Automatically deploy your code when it is pushed to Github!

Build a complex multi-container application from scratch and deploy it to AWS

Understand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes

We are going to build a web scraper for HackerNews, build a Twitter bot,  build the most secure password checker and we will also build some automation tools using Selenium. But the best part? We will build an actual portfolio website using Python that your future employer and customers can contact you at. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.




Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Python and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects.




Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Python skills, or are coming from a different programming language, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no coding experience to someone that can go off, forget about me, and build their own applications and get hired.




Taught By:

Andrei Neagoie is the instructor of the highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. 

Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. 

Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. 

Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

Below is a partial list of the topics you'll find in this course:

Master the fundamental features of React, including JSX, state, and props

From square one, understand how to build reusable components

Dive into the source code of Redux to understand how it works behind the scenes

Test your knowledge and hone your skills with numerous coding exercises

Use popular styling libraries to build beautiful apps

See different methods of building UI's through composition of components

Remember all these techniques with clearly-written cheatsheets




Besides just React and Redux, you'll pick up countless other tidbits of knowledge, including design techniques, popular design patterns, and repeatable steps to build new components.

This is the course I wanted to take when I first learned React: complete, up-to-date, and clear.

5 STARS - Excellent, fabulous. The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is really awesome. What an effort .. Thanks a million

5 STARS - A lot of preparation work has taken place from the teacher and this is visible throughout the course.

5 STARS - This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be.

5 STARS - The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does.

5 STARS - I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early.

5 STARS - Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.

Learn why TypeScript is amazing, how it improves your JavaScript code and how it helps you avoid nasty bugs and errors!

This course takes you from the very basics and its most important feature (types!) to the point where you're able to use TypeScript in any of your projects. ReactJS projects included!

As TypeScript is developed by Microsoft and strongly advertised and used by Angular 2+ (Google) and other popular libraries, it's here to stay. Indeed, TypeScript is one of the most popular web development languages you can learn these days!

Gain an edge today and be amongst the first to really understand TypeScript!

Learn how you can use TypeScript to bring modern JS features like destructuring, arrow functions or classes to any environment and codebase - even if it does not support those features yet!  Understand which types you may use and how you can build your own types. Learn how to write better code with types and with the many features offered by TypeScript!

But, in this course, we'll not stop after the basics! You will also learn about more advanced features (like decorators) and also how to set up workflows with  TypeScript. This includes a TypeScript-only workflow as well as a webpack workflow.

You'll also learn that you're not limited to Angular or plain JavaScript/ TypeScript projects. Instead, a complete module covers how you may use TypeScript with ReactJS and improve your React code with TypeScript as well.

Practice what you learn!

Watching videos is a great way to learn. And to a lot of students, it's the best way. If you also want to practice the things you learn, this course offers you more than that though. Because this course comes with plenty of exercises (and solutions, of course) in addition to all the high-quality learning videos.

So much Content!

I'm not a fan of these courses which teach you the basics and then leave you alone. Instead, in this course you'll get insights into:

Types and how to use them

How the TypeScript compiler works (and how you may configure it)

ES6 features with TypeScript

Classes in TypeScript

Namespaces and modules

Truly knowing Javascript will get you a job, and enable you to build quality web and server applications.

NOTE: This course includes information on ECMAScript 6 (ES6) the next version of Javascript!

In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Javascript, learn how Javascript works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems. You will find clarity in the parts that others, even experienced coders, may find weird, odd, and at times incomprehensible. You'll learn the beauty and deceptive power of this language that is at the forefront of modern software development today.

This course will cover such advanced concepts as objects and object literals, function expressions, prototypical inheritance, functional programming, scope chains, function constructors (plus new ES6 features), immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs), call, apply, bind, and more.

We'll take a deep dive into the source code of popular frameworks such as jQuery and Underscore to see how you can use your understanding of Javascript to learn (and borrow) from other's good code.

Finally, you'll learn the foundations of how to build your own Javascript framework or library.


What you'll learn in this course will make you a better Javascript developer, and improve your abilities in AngularJS, NodeJS, jQuery, React, Ember, MongoDB, and all other Javascript-based technologies!

Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.  

But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.  

--- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---  

Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there:  

1. ROBUST STRUCTURE   

The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.   

That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.  

2. INTUITION TUTORIALS  

So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.  

With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.  

3. EXCITING PROJECTS  

Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?  

Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.  

Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:  

Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem  

Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition  

Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices  

Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud  

Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System  

Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the Netflix $1 Million prize  

*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.  

4. HANDS-ON CODING   

In Deep Learning A-Z we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.   

In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.   

This is a course which naturally extends into your career.  

5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT  

Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?   

Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.  

In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.   

No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed.   

--- The Tools ---  

Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!  

TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.   

PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.  

So which is better and for what?   

Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.  

The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.  

--- More Tools ---  

Theano is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.  

Keras is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.  

--- Even More Tools ---  

Scikit-learn the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:    

to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation  

to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning  

to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions  

And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.   

Plus, throughout the course we will be using Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays, Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.  

--- Who Is This Course For? ---  

As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.   

If you are just starting out into Deep Learning, then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course. You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.   

If you already have experience with Deep Learning, you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.   

--- Real-World Case Studies ---  

Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:  

#1 Churn Modelling Problem  

In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.   

Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.   

If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.  

#2 Image Recognition  

In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.   

For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!  

#3 Stock Price Prediction  

In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to “Artificial Intelligence”. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.   

The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!   

In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.   

 #4 Fraud Detection  

According to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.    

This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.   

This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.  

#5 & 6 Recommender Systems  

From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.  

We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.   

Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.  

Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.  

And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!    

--- Summary ---  

In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.   

We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!

Authentication? You will learn it.  Hooks? Included.  Navigation? Of course!

This course will get you up and running with React Native quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build React components for mobile devices.

Both OSX and Windows supported - develop iOS or Android!

This course includes content on both v0.62.2 and the legacy v0.30.x, which is widely used in industry.


We'll start by mastering the fundamentals of React, including JSX, “props"", “state"", and event handling. Source code is provided for each lecture, so you will always stay up-to-date with the course pacing.  Special attention has been paid to creating reusable components that you'll be able to make use of on your own fantastic projects.

React Native is an excellent solution for developing apps on mobile in a fraction of the time it takes to make an equivalent iOS or Swift app.  You'll love seeing your changes instantly appear on your own device, rather than waiting for Swift/Java code to recompile!  This quick feedback loop, along with excellent cross platform support, is what has catapulted React Native to the top must-have skill for Javascript engineers.

If you are new to React, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the React course for you! To learn React you have to understand it.

Learn how to use React's custom markup language, JSX, to clean up your Javascript code

Master the process of breaking down a complex component into many smaller, interchangeable components

Grasp the difference between “props"" and “state"" and when to use each

Render interactive, media-rich components in beautifully styled apps

Do you feel confused with CSS jargon like inheritance, specificity, or the cascade?

What if there was one resource, one place, where you could learn all the advanced and modern CSS techniques and properties you've been reading about?

Good news: there is!

Welcome to ""Advanced CSS and Sass"", the most advanced, the most modern, and the most complete CSS course on the internet. It's everything you want in an advanced CSS course, and more.

You will learn complex CSS animations, advanced responsive design techniques, flexbox layouts, Sass, CSS architecture, fundamental CSS concepts, and so much more.

Like in all my courses, you will build beautiful and carefully designed projects, that will make you proud of yourself and leave you ready to build complex projects on your own.

After finishing this course, you will:

1) Be up to speed with the most modern and advanced CSS properties and techniques;

2) Have mastered the cutting-edge layout technologies Flexbox and CSS Grid;

3) Be ready to build responsive layouts for all kinds of devices and situations;

4) Truly understand how CSS works behind the scenes;

5) Be able to architect large CSS codebases for reusability and maintainability using Sass.

Please note that this course is NOT for absolute beginners, so you should already be at an intermediate level in HTML and CSS (please check out my other course if that's not the case).

 

This course is massive, coming in at 28+ hours. Here is exactly what you will learn:

Tons of modern cutting-edge CSS techniques to create stunning designs and effects: clip-path, background-clip, mask-image, background-blend-mode, shape-outside, filter, backdrop-filter, object-fit, transform, column-count, hyphens, perspective, calc() and custom CSS properties;

Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation, and transition;

Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements required for modern CSS development;

How CSS works behind the scenes: the cascade, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, box types, positioning schemes, and stacking contexts;

CSS architecture: The 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable, and scalable code;

Introduction to Sass: variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more;

Using Sass in real-world projects: setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS, and managing media queries;

The NPM ecosystem: setting up a development process to compile Sass and automatic browser reload, and creating a build process to concatenate, prefix, and compress CSS files;

Modern responsive design: fluid grids, layout types, flexible images, using media queries to test for different screen widths, pixel densities, and touch capabilities;

Advanced responsive design workflows: mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, selecting breakpoints, em vs rem units and feature queries to test for browser support;

Videos in HTML and CSS: building a background video effect;

Flexbox layouts: main concepts, introduction to both flex container and flex item-specific properties, advanced positioning techniques applied to a huge real-world project;

CSS Grid layouts: main concepts, CSS grid vs flexbox, and layout techniques applied to a real-world project. This part alone could be an entire course!

 

Why should you take this course?

So you saw that the course is absolutely full-packed with content. But maybe you're still not sure if you should actually learn advanced CSS?

That's probably because CSS is so easy to get started with. In fact, most developers highly underestimate the importance and power of CSS. But nothing could be further away from the truth!

CSS is what makes our design come to life. And there is so much we can do with it! Mastering advanced techniques like flexbox, CSS grid, and animations, will give you an edge over many CSS developers out there who still use outdated methods.

Plus, CSS can become a real nightmare when you try to master it, and when you have to maintain large projects. So having a good grasp on fundamental concepts is an absolute must for any serious front-end developer.

And this course will help you with all that!

So, should you take this course? The answer is most likely a big YES!

And I packed so much content into this course, that no matter if you're just starting out, or if you're already an experienced front-end developer, there is definitely gonna be something for you in this course.

Unity is an incredible 3D package used for making video games, architectural and medical imaging and more. The challenge is that it's big and complicated to use, especially for complete beginners to coding and game development. We make learning to code easy and fun by leading you step-by-step through the process of creating exciting games.

Get plugged into our communities of amazing developers on Facebook (nearly 20k), in our own Teaching Assistant-curated Community, and our student Discord chat channel.

This course has full professional-produced English closed-captions.

If you're reading this you probably already have everything you need to get started. Unity is a free download. With regular access to an internet connection you'll be able to engage in our thriving community. Even if you have no experience with coding, or with 3D packages, we will guide you through everything from first principles. Starting slow, then building on what you learn, you'll soon have a very solid working knowledge of Unity.

Don't take our word for it, please see the amazing reviews students have taken the time to write. We are proud to be transforming lives, and equipping 1000s of people with valuable new skills. We would love you to become one of them now.

The course is project-based, so you will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to real indie games as you go. All the project files will be included, as well as additional references and resources - you'll never get stuck. There are ""talking heads"", powerful diagrams, quality screencasts and more.

For each demo game you build you will follow this process...

Be challenged to build the entire game yourself.

Be shown step-by step how to build it.

Be challenged to apply, and re-apply your knowledge regularly.

Prefer to focus on 2D? Check-out our Complete Unity Developer 2D course. Want something a little more advanced? Check-out our epic Unity RPG course. Want to get certified, get a job, or learn environment art - we've got you covered. The green leaf logo is your sign of quality.

You will get full lifetime access for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.

Push Notifications, Hooks, Redux",Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller,4.7,English,Last updated 1/2024,"Mobile apps are one of the best ways to engage with users - no wonder everyone wants to build one!

But wouldn't it be amazing if you could use your web development knowledge, combined with your React knowledge, to build mobile apps with that?

That's exactly what React Native allows you to do!

No need to learn Java, Android, Swift, ObjectiveC or anything of that - React and JavaScript is all you need to create awesome native mobile apps that work on both Android and iOS. That's probably the reason why Instagram, AirBnB, Skype and many other global companies are using it to build their mobile apps!

With this course, you can join this league. I'll teach you all you need to create your own React Native apps, publish them to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store and dive really deep into the React Native ecosystem.

You'll learn all about the theory behind React Native, its core concepts, how to build responsive designs that work on different device sizes, how to navigate around, use maps and the camera and so much more!

And which better way to learn than by building a real app? We'll build the ""Favorite Places"" app in this course, an app where users can share amazing pictures and the location where they took them. This app will allow you to see things like using maps, the camera, user authentication, connecting to a server and much more in action.

By the end of the course, we'll of course also go through all steps required to get it into an app store.

Here's a detailed look at what you'll get:

The core concepts and theory

How to use React, JavaScript and native components

Understand how to navigate in React Native apps

A closer look at styling and animating React Native apps

Instructions on how to use third-party libraries in your React Native app

Detailed examples on how to use maps or an image picker

A full user authentication flow

How to connect to a backend server from your app

Debugging instructions

And so much more!

What will you need to succeed in this course?

NO Android, Java, Swift or ObjectiveC knowledge is required!

JavaScript and React (for the web) knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)

I'd be very happy to welcome you in the course!

Learn key AI concepts with intuition lectures to get you quickly up to speed with all things AI and practice them by building 5 different AIs:




Build an AI with a Q-Learning model and train it to optimize warehouse flows in a Process Optimization case study.

Build an AI with a Deep Q-Learning model and train it to land on the moon.

Build an AI with a Deep Convolutional Q-Learning model and train it to play the game of Pac-Man.

Build an AI with an A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) model and train it to fight Kung Fu.

Build an AI by fine-tuning a powerful pre-trained LLM (Llama 2 by Meta) with Hugging Face and re-train it to chat with you about an augmented domain knowledge in medicine.




Besides, you will get a free 3-hour extra course on Generative AI and LLMs as a Prize for completing the course.




And last but not least, here is what you will get with this course:




1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.

2. Hassle-Free Coding and Code templates – We will build all our AIs in Google Colab, which means that we will have absolutely NO hassle installing libraries or packages because everything is already pre-installed in Google Colab notebooks. Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates (in .py and .ipynb) for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.

3. Intuition Tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in AI for much better results down the line.

4. Real-world solutions – You’ll achieve your goal in not only one AI model but in 5. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.

5. In-course support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.

Most companies today realize that the practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits like increased business revenue and faster time-to-market. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.




There are a plethora of tools available in the CI/CD/DevOps landscape today. Implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment with these tools and frameworks can help us immensely in modernizing our software development lifecycle. It catches us bugs early and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost for software development in startups and enterprise alike.




But before getting into tools and frameworks, it is important that you get a holistic picture of CI / CD and DevOps. For this, you need to understand where we started from - the old school traditional software development cycle. We will pick holes in the old model, identify pain points and learn how CI / CD and DevOps evolved, one step at a time. Once you build a rock solid foundation using this course, you can move on to more specific tool oriented courses.




If you are thinking about moving on to CI/CD/DevOps from your old school software development model, this course is for you. Well illustrated with animations to help you grasp a clear understanding of the underlying principles. Once you complete this course, you can take on bigger challenges related to implementation.




The demand for professionals who have experience with CI/CD/DevOps has been growing steadily over the last few years. The salaries for these skills have gone through the roof and are only bound to go up as the demand for these skills increases. Professionals with CI / CD / DevOps skill set can demand as much as $150K as their yearly compensation as per latest US job and salary surveys. And this is where you start!",krishna.kishore B.

Real-world examples including

How to manage your daily task-list via a daily scrum-based process

Configure permissions and projects for internal team members, as well as external members (Eg: consultants, customers etc)

JIRA allows you to create stories and epics for agile projects - learn how to create another issue type used in agile called Spike and create custom screens, fields and workflows for this new issue type.

Modify the default software development workflow to include steps for QA

How to manage multiple teams working on the same projects via multiple agile boards catered to each team

Support - I am only a message away from answering any questions you might have




STRUCTURE OF THE COURSE:

Agile Concepts - Goes into detail with Scrum and Kanban methodologies. By the end of the section, you’ll have a full refresher on these methodologies as I made sure I hit the most important notes when it comes to how they work.

Working within an agile team - Get your first look at navigating the Jira user interface and learn how to create issues, work on issues through the agile boards, search for issues, create custom dashboards to see whats happening in Jira and other functions beneficial to any agile team member.

Leading an agile team - Configuring and managing agile boards, creating and maintaining the backlog as well as starting and ending sprints and creating releases. All these steps stay true to the agile steps described in the prior section.

Jira Administration - Goes over all the main administration sections and each part has an example that you can use to follow along with. By the end of this section, you will understand all the customizable aspects of Jira and be able to cater your own instance to fit your own specific needs.

Real-world examples, scenarios and bonus content - This is where I show you how I use Jira to track and forecast my personal day-to-day tasklist, while using a daily scrum-based process, among other examples.

Confluence - Jira's best friend when it comes to managing content




BOTTOM LINE:

Bottom line is that I tried to make this course a comprehensive guide to Jira that anyone would need to either get introduced to JIRA or get fully up to speed with the basic concepts and features. I feel the best way of learning something is by example. And so I put in a lot of content explaining the features and concepts with examples and am continuously working on adding more examples and scenarios to share my experience and knowledge in using JIRA within the real world.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS




1- Does this course cover ASP.NET Core 1.0? 

No! Once you master ASP.NET MVC 5, you can quickly get up to speed with ASP.NET Core. Mosh has a follow up course on Udemy called ""Build a Real-world App with ASP.NET Core and Angular"". In this course, you'll get up to speed with ASP.NET Core in the context of building a real app from A to Z. 




2- Why should I pay for this course when there are lots of free tutorials available?

Free tutorials and YouTube videos are free for a reason. They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you'll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you'll be confident that you're in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love. 

Plus, many of these free tutorials, including tutorials published by Microsoft on the official ASP.NET website, teach you poor practices. Throughout this course, Mosh points out some of these poor practices and explains in technical terms why you should avoid them. 




WHAT OTHER STUDENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE SAY




""The is course is very much worth your time and money. Mosh did an outstanding job explaining each aspect of MVC 5 as well as introducing and using other technologies such as Web API. I've been working with MVC since it's release but felt I needed a refresher course and this was excellent. I would also recommend it to developers just getting into MVC as well because Mosh does a great job of explaining the concepts behind what you're learning. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it."" -Scott Smith





""Course teaches exactly what the title promises to teach. Quality of production, content, and lectures are excellent! Explanations of the how and why are also a nice touch!"" -Pierre Gadea




""Mosh never disappoints. Clear explanations. Exercises that will test you knowledge. Great instruction as always. I also love that he includes shortcuts and best practices. Worth the time and money!"" -Lara Caves




""Amazing course from Mosh! After I finished the C# series, I moved directly to this course and learn so much and even developed a successful web app in my internship! Thanks Mosh for a great course!!"" -Menny Atia




""I've been into web development for more than 15 years, but until recently I was totally new to ASP.NET MVC. Before taking this course I tried other courses, but these were either too complicated for a beginner or didn't cover all the necessery informations needed to get started. This is an excellent course to begin with ASP.NET MVC that covers everything you need to create a real world project. The prerequisites are a good understaning of C# (OOP, Lambdas, LINQ...) , Javascript and JQuery"" -Marko Pavic




""Professionally structured, carefully planned course. Passionate, engaging instructor with great communication skills. Best course I've ever had on Udemy so far. I would love to take the follow-up course on architecture and testing mentioned in the final video."" -Istvan Voros




""One of the best courses i have ever taken,Recommend for every C# developer through his all the courses in Udemy. They are eye-openers and it will change the way you think about Programming.After taking his courses ,with in a span of one month i have a cracked a interview in one of the Big 4 with 70% hike."" -Rama Reddy

Become a better dev in other languages by learning C.   Pointers explained,Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy,4.4,English,Last updated 11/2023,"Have you never programmed a computer before, and think or have been told that C is a good programming language to get started with.  It is!

Maybe you have some experience with other programming languages, but want to learn C.  It's a great language to add to your resume!

Or perhaps you are stuck in a low paying programming job, and want to move up to a better, more senior position.  Learning C can help you!


The fact is, learning how to program in C is not only an excellent programming language to get started with, but it will also make you a better programming in other computer languages!

Why learn C ?


C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it.

Though C is simple it is one of the most powerful languages ever created.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world.


Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++, Java, or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs.

By learning how things really work ""under the hood"", and understand memory space, CPU architecture and so on, you can create more efficient programs, and obtain a huge advantage over other programmers in the process.

If you want to become a better developer, learning C is a great way to start!

Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.


By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamentals of the C Programming Language, and make yourself more marketable for entry level programming positions.

You will understand variables and the different data types, be able to utilize functions and arrays, understand the  concept of pointers, learn about control flow (decision statements and iteration).

You will be in a position to apply for real-time programming positions, and truly understand the core language that most modern languages are based on!

If you have previously used the C programming language, then this course will deepen your understanding of it. If you have never used it, no problem, you will see that it can help you become a more efficient C developer.


The course will be constantly refined in the future based on student feedback!

This course does not skip on the details.  You will learn how to write high quality code and become an excellent problem solver.  This course does not just present how to code in the C programming language, but, also includes all the details on ""why"" you are doing the things you are doing.  At the end of this course, you will fully understand the concepts of the C Programming language.


Your instructor, Jason Fedin has been teaching students for over 12 years via online classes at over 10 different online Universities. He has created many different class curriculums, ranging from mobile programming to bash scripting to Object-Oriented Design and of course the C programming language.

Additionally, he has been developing software for over 16 years in the real world at various companies, specializing in Object-Oriented Development and Mobile Applications.

This means you are learning from someone who has all the professional training, skills, and experience you need to teach you how to become proficient in the C programming language.

If you are ready to get that first paid programming job, or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you!

No fluff or unnecessary repetition - don't waste your time on long courses 
Clear, concise, and practical training - start coding right away 
Learn how to think like a programmer - most, if not all, courses just teach you JavaScript features, not the art of problem solving 
JavaScript interview questions - many of the exercises in the course are picked from popular interview questions 
Fun and engaging - just read Mosh's reviews and see what his students have to say




WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR? 

Aspiring developers - perhaps you learned a little bit of HTML and CSS and want to take your first JavaScript programming course. This course is an ideal starting point.  
Experienced developers with no degree in computer science - there are a lot of self-taught web developers out there who cannot solve basic programming problems, because they never attended a college. Don't be one of those! This course teaches you the fundamental programming skills that every developer must know. 
Anyone who wants to better understand JavaScript - chances are you've taken another course but didn't understand certain topics well. You can take this course to fill the gaps and strengthen your understanding of JavaScript. 

NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE NEEDED

You don't need familiarity with JavaScript to take this course. You'll learn everything from scratch, step-by-step. A very basic familiarity with HTML will be helpful but it is not required.




ARE YOU READY TO MAKE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS BECOMING A WEB OR MOBILE DEVELOPER?

Stop wasting your time on disconnected tutorials or super long courses. Enroll in the course to get started. With a 30-day money-back guarantee, what do you have to lose?

Machine Learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere; if you want to know how companies like Google, Amazon, and even Udemy extract meaning and insights from massive data sets, this data science course will give you the fundamentals you need. Data Scientists enjoy one of the top-paying jobs, with an average salary of $120,000 according to Glassdoor and Indeed. That's just the average! And it's not just about money - it's interesting work too!

If you've got some programming or scripting experience, this course will teach you the techniques used by real data scientists and machine learning practitioners in the tech industry - and prepare you for a move into this hot career path. This comprehensive machine learning tutorial includes over 130 lectures spanning over 18 hours of video, and most topics include hands-on Python code examples you can use for reference and for practice. I’ll draw on my 9 years of experience at Amazon and IMDb to guide you through what matters, and what doesn’t.

Each concept is introduced in plain English, avoiding confusing mathematical notation and jargon. It’s then demonstrated using Python code you can experiment with and build upon, along with notes you can keep for future reference. You won't find academic, deeply mathematical coverage of these algorithms in this course - the focus is on practical understanding and application of them. At the end, you'll be given a final project to apply what you've learned!

Recent Course UpdatesAdded Updates and Errata sectionAdded Tagging section
 Course Outline  Course Introduction and Overview provides an introduction to this course and the Git source control system and sets the stage for the rest of the course. 
 After the introduction, the first thing we do is Git Installation for both Windows and Mac. 
 Quick Start a very quick (15 minutes), hands-on introduction to Git. We start off by signing up for GitHub, creating a repository there, the makiing a local copy (clone), local changes (add/commit) and then update GitHub with our changes (push). 
 In Basic Commands, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history. 
 With a strong foundation in place, we explore ways to make Comparisons in Git, including all the different local states, between commits, and between local and remote repositories. 
 We give great attending to Branching and Merging in Git. We start off with the simple ""happy path"" and learn about ""Fast-Forward"" merges and how to control them. The we walk through common ""automatic"" merges. Finally, we cause trouble on purpose so we can step through resolving conflicting merges with our visual merge tool. 
 With a strong foundation in branching and merging, we will then cover a more complex topic, Rebasing. In that section, we cover several rebasing examples, including how to resolve a rebase conflict. 
 In the Stashing section, we save our work-in-progress while we attend to more pressing issues, then pick up where we left off after that. 
NEW: In the Tagging section, we mark important milestones or releases within our project. We also use those tags later for comparing differences between important milestones. We also look at how to use tags within GitHub.
 All tools have installation and configuration sections to ensure no one is left behind. 
 Course Features  Presentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum. 
 Screencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is nearly 4 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail. 
 Several attachments and document lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.

Welcome to the Modern Python 3 Bootcamp!  I've launched my fair share of Udemy courses, but I've never done anything quite this crazy.

This course is a unique experience on Udemy. There are dozens of existing Python courses you can choose from, but this course is the only one that has nearly 200 interactive challenges you can complete right here in your browser. I didn't just tack on a couple of exercises at the end; this course is fully built around the coding exercises.   This course is all about getting you writing code ASAP, rather than sitting back watching a bunch of videos.  

In development, I referred to this course as a hybrid between a typical Udemy course and an interactive Codecademy-style course.  You get over 25 hours of in-depth videos and my dumb jokes along with meticulously created exercises and quizzes to test your knowledge as you go.

Many of the older Python courses still focus on Python 2.  This course is all about writing the most modern, up-to-date Python code, so Python 3 was the obvious choice.  The course covers all the latest additions and changes to the Python language.  The course also places a large emphasis on thinking like a Python developer, and writing code the ""Pythonic"" way.

As for the curriculum, This course teaches all the key topics covered by other Python courses, but also covers more advanced topics like web scraping, crawling, and testing, just to name a few.  Please feel free to explore the curriculum and watch some of the free preview videos!

Python is consistently ranked in either first or second place as the most in-demand programming languages across the job market.  It has applications in data science, machine learning, web development, self-driving cars, automation, and many many other disciplines.  There has never been a better time to learn it!


I'm spent years teaching people to program at in-person bootcamps in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In recent years, I've started bringing my methods from the classroom to the online world. In my first year teaching online, I was selected as the Best Newcomer Instructor in the Udemy Instructor Awards 2015.  I'm passionate about making the best possible online learning experiences that mirror my in-person courses.

Learn V8, Express, the MEAN stack, core Javascript concepts, and more.",Anthony Alicea,4.5,English,Last updated 6/2023,"NodeJS is a rapidy growing web server technology, and Node developers are among the highest paid in the industry. Knowing NodeJS well will get you a job or improve your current one by enabling you to build high quality, robust web applications.

In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Node, learn how NodeJS works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems.

In this course we'll look at how the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript. You'll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using modules and understand how modules really work.

You'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node.

We'll dive into web sites, web apps and APIs with Express and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.

You'll also gain an understanding of npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack!

During it all you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.

NodeJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.

I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand NodeJS.

Note: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.",Pablo M.

Have you ever had an idea for a program, an app, or a game?

Maybe you want to work as a developer? Then you are in the right place. In this course, you are going to discover how to become a c# developer - one of the best programming languages on earth!

C# is one of the few programming languages which allows you to create amazing cross-platform Mobile Apps, Games, and PC Programs. 

Bringing an Idea to life is one of the best feelings one can have, but the path to get there is often full of challenges. So I have created a course that makes this path as easy as possible all with the help of c# so that you become a skilled c# developer!




You start off by learning the C# basics and C# programming concepts in general:

variables

methods

arrays

if statements

loops

Then you learn the three pillars of Object-oriented programming.

Classes and Objects

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Once you mastered them, you will go into advanced C# Topics, such as:

Databases

Linq

WPF

Test-Driven Development TDD (Unit Testing)

In order to really become really good in c# programming, you have to program yourself, so I have created loads of exercises (and quizzes) for you to try for yourself to do c# programming and also to see how it is done afterward. Of course, you learn the best programming practices along the way.




Equipped with those skills, you will build beautiful user interfaces with WPF - A framework, which makes creating GUI’s a piece of cake.
By that point, you can create your very own complex programs.
But what comes next is even cooler.

Learn Game Development with Unity and C# - Build 3 awesome games.

As C# can be used for multiple different areas of programming, I have decided to cover the most important ones. So I have added a whole bunch of chapters specifically designed for a C# developer and Unity game developer - arguably the best Game Engine in the world. In those chapters, you will discover how to create your very own video games by building pong, the mother of video games, and Zig-zag, an amazing and successful endless runner game.

We live in a world where knowledge and work are shared more than ever, so using assets provided by others is a huge boost to your progress.  You will learn how to use 3D assets to make an endless runner. Then you’ll use animations, reset the game, use particle systems, and finally create a map procedurally. That’s quite some advanced stuff right there.




I know that learning to code can be hard at times, and sometimes you just get stuck. But no worries, we are there for you. We answer each question as quickly as we can and make sure that you reach your goal of becoming a developer.




WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?


The course is for anyone, who wants to learn c# and wants to become professionally good in c# programming. No experience is required whatsoever. It is designed so that anyone who can handle a mouse and keyboard will succeed in finishing it. The only real requisite is the desire to learn.

JavaScript is THE most important programming language you need to learn as a web developer - and with this course, you make sure that you will not miss a single thing you have to know as a JavaScript developer!

This is the most comprehensive and modern course you can find on JavaScript - it's based on all my JavaScript knowledge AND teaching experience. It's both a complete guide, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an extensive reference of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course!

It's a huge course packed with important knowledge and helpful content:

From the core basics, over advanced concepts and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all. My goal was to create your go-to resource for the JavaScript language, which you can not just use for learning it but also as a resource you can come back to and look up important topics.

The course is based on my experience as a long-term JavaScript developer as well as a teacher with more than 2,500,000 students on Udemy as well as on my YouTube channel Academind. It's packed with examples, demos, projects, assignments, quizzes and of course videos - all with the goal of giving you the best possible way of learning JavaScript.

What's in the course?

This course is obviously packed with content - I therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course:

Modern JavaScript from the start: The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the latest syntax from the start (you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY JS project)

ALL the Basics: Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc

Arrays & Objects: We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail

Control Structures: Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops

A look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us

Deep dives into Core Concepts: ALL the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes

Working with the DOM: How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases)

Events in JavaScript: Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag & drop) and execute appropriate code

Classes & Object-oriented Programming: Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the ""this"" keyword, constructor functions and much more

Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming: We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/ await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly

Http Requests: Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript

Tooling, Optimizations & Browser Support: Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers  - this matters and hence is covered in great detail

Libraries & Frameworks: Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like React.js - why they matter and how to use them

Node.js: Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment

Security & Performance Optimizations: Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course!

Automated Testing: Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing

What are the course prerequisites?

NO JavaScript knowledge is required - you'll learn it from scratch!

You also need NO programming experience other than basic web development knowledge (e.g. how the web works)

Basic HTML and CSS knowledge is recommended but not a must-have"

Become a Senior React Developer. Build a massive E-commerce app with Redux, Hooks, GraphQL, Stripe, Firebase",Andrei Neagoie,4.6,English,Last updated 9/2023,"Just FULLY updated and re-recorded with all new React features (React v18)! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto with React.js.

Using the latest version of React (React 18), this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore. Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.

We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on React. This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer. Along the way, we will build a massive e-commerce application similar to Shopify using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is going to be a full stack app (MERN stack), using Firebase.

The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects.

All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t like to code along, you will get access to the the full master project code so anyone signed up for the course will have their own project to put on their portfolio right away.

The topics covered will be:

- React Basics

- React Router

- Redux

- Redux Saga

- Asynchronous Redux

- React Hooks

- Context API

- React Suspense + React Lazy

- Firebase

- Stripe API

- PWAs

- React Performance

- React Design Patterns

- Testing with Jest and Snapshot testing

- React Best Practices

- Persistance + Session Storage

- State Normalization

+ more




Wait wait… I know what you’re thinking. Why aren’t we building 10+ projects? Well, here’s the truth: Most courses teach you React and do just that. They show you how to get started, build 10 projects that are simple and easy to build in a day, and just add some CSS to make them look fancy. In real life though, you’re not building silly applications. When you apply to jobs, nobody is going to care that you built a really pretty To Do app. Employers want to see you build large apps that can scale, that have good architecture, and that can be deployed to production.




Let me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other React tutorial online:




1. You will build the biggest project you will see in any course. This type of project would take you months to implement yourself.




2. This course is taught by 2 instructors that have actually worked for some of the biggest tech firms using React in production. Yihua has been working on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and probably have shopped at. Andrei has worked on enterprise level React applications for large IPOed tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. By having both of them teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 senior developers as if you are working at a company together.




3. We learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using the instructor's experiences you learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let’s just say we don’t shy away from the advanced topics.




This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers. 




Taught By:


Andrei Neagoie is the instructor of the highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. 

Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. 

Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. 

Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.  

See you inside the courses!

Build a real e-commerce app with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap 4",Mosh Hamedani,4.4,English,Last updated 4/2018,"


Angular is one of the most popular frameworks for building client apps with HTML, CSS and TypeScript. If you want to establish yourself as a front-end or a full-stack developer, you need to learn Angular.




If you've been confused or frustrated jumping from one Angular 4 tutorial to another, you've come to the right place. In this course, Mosh, author of several best-selling courses on Udemy, takes you on a fun and pragmatic journey to master Angular 4. 




By the end of watching this course, you'll be able to: 

Build real client apps with Angular on your own 
Troubleshoot common compile-time and run-time errors
Write clean and maintainable code like a professional
Apply best practices when building Angular apps 







Right from the beginning, you'll jump in and build your first Angular app within minutes. Say goodbye to boring tutorials and courses with rambling instructors and useless theories! 




Angular 2+ has been written in TypeScript. So, in section 2, you'll learn the fundamentals of TypeScript and object-oriented programming to better understand and appreciate this powerful framework. 




Over the next 8 hours, you'll learn the essentials of building client apps with Angular: 

Displaying data and handling events
Building re-usable components
Manipulating the DOM using directives 
Formatting data using pipes
Building template-driven and reactive forms 
Consuming HTTP services 
Handling HTTP errors properly 
Using Reactive Extensions and observables 
Adding routing and navigation
Implementing authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) 
Deploying your applications to GitHub Pages, Firebase and Heroku




So, if you're a busy developer with limited time and want to quickly learn how to build and deploy client apps with Angular, you can stop here. 




If you're more adventurous and want to learn more, there is far more content for you! Over the following sections, you'll learn about more advanced topics: 

Building real-time, server-less apps with Firebase 
Animating DOM elements using Angular animations
Building beautiful UIs using Angular Material
Implementing the Redux architecture 
Writing unit and integration tests 




All that covers just over 21 hours of high-quality content. This is equivalent to a book with more than a thousand pages! But the kind of book that every line is worth reading, not a book that you want to skim! If you have taken any of Mosh's courses before, you know he is very clear and concise in his teaching and doesn't waste a single minute of your precious time!




Finally, at the end of the course, you'll build and deploy a real-time e-commerce application with Angular 4, Firebase 4 and Bootstrap 4. This application exhibits patterns that you see in a lot of real-world applications:

Master/detail
CRUD operations
Forms with custom validation
Searching, sorting and pagination
Authentication and authorization 
And a lot more! 




You'll see how Mosh creates a brand new Angular project with Angular CLI and builds this application from A to Z, step-by-step. No copy/pasting! These 8.5 hours are packed with tips that you can only learn from a seasoned developer. 




You'll learn how to apply best practices, refactor your code and produce high quality code like a professional developer. You'll learn about Mosh's design decisions along the way and why he chooses a certain approach. What he shares with you comes from his 17 years of experience as a professional software developer. 




You're not going to get this information in other Angular courses out there! 







And on top of all these, you'll get: 

Closed-captions generated by a human, not a computer! Currently only the first few sections have closed-captions but new captions are being added every week. 
Offline access: if you are traveling or have a slow connection, you can download the videos and watch them offline.
Downloadable source code







PREREQUISITES

You don't need familiarity with TypeScript or any previous versions of Angular. You're going to learn both TypeScript and Angular from scratch in this course.

Welcome to Master Practical Java Development.  This course is designed to help you master the most in-demand and critical components for becoming a Core Java developer. Especially if you're going for a job interview or have a Java Project that needs your best performance. This course assumes no prior java experience so  prior Java so it will take you from zero to hero!

The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I've got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You'll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as countless methods with loops and if else statements, exception handling and file processing as well as how to debug software using Eclipse. You'll also be mastering the collections framework and diving deep into java generics. You'll learn all there is to know about multi-threading and the JDBC API for working with a MySQL database. There are also practical projects scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them. For example one of the projects is related to a car dealership management system and another assignment involves processing files with stock market data. So as you can see, I tried to keep the projects professional and industry relevant rather than cloning a game like flappy bird.

I want this course to be the ultimate go-to resource for anyone that's looking to become a core Java programmer so I intend on adding more content to this course based on new technologies and student feedback. The content is Java 9 ready which means I'll show you how to upgrade to the latest version of Java which is version 9 and I'll teach you how to configure Eclipse to work with both Java 8 as well as version 9.


Don’t just take it from me, take it from other students that have taken this course.




★★★★★ Here’s reviews from real students that took this course ★★★★★




★★★★★ Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I know nothing about java and so far I’m keeping up just fine.




★★★★★ Easy to understand the difficult topics as well. Overall nice course. Learnt the basic java concepts very well and also collections framework and JDBC topics are also very nicely explained.




★★★★★ The explanation of each concept is done very well. This is a great course for beginners.


★★★★★ This course is awesome! The teacher is very thorough with his explanations of the theory and application. I'm really enjoying it!


★★★★★ Yes it is for sure the best!! As it covers all the topic from basic to advanced topics in java.


★★★★★ I am taking my second semester of Java programming at university. I signed up for this course to augment my university studies. I learn more from this one course with a better understanding of programming principles than I have learned at university.The university gives me college credit; this course will get me a job!

There can be no understating it: Ethereum and Blockchain technology is the most disruptive force in years.  Companies cannot hire developers who understand blockchain technologies fast enough, but there are a tiny number of resources published to help you truly understand what blockchains are used for, let alone build apps with them.  That's the purpose of this course: to be the best resource online for learning about Ethereum, blockchains, and how to build apps with this new technology.

The development community is still figuring out the best way to use Ethereum in the creation of new and exciting apps.  I spent a tremendous amount of time to research and create best practice for interfacing with Ethereum from Javascript.  I can't overstate it enough; this course will show you the best and most easily repeatable patterns for creating production-ready apps with Ethereum.




What tools and libraries are used?

The Ethereum tech ecosystem is in constant change.  Don't be fooled by other courses that mention how you'll learn a dozen different libraries!  Every library that you'll use with Ethereum breaks and is deprecated on a near-weekly basis!  Instead, this course will teach you how to assemble your own boilerplate package to develop, compile, and test Smart Contracts.  By learning the core technologies, you'll be prepared to adjust to Ethereum no matter how the ecosystem changes.


What is Ethereum?


Ethereum is a cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin, and it has been heralded as Bitcoins successor.  Whereas Bitcoin currently has issues scaling with an increasing backlog of transactions, Ethereum is poised to surpass Bitcoin in performance, popularity, and value.  Ethereum was created to help developers like you create applications focused around transferring money or value from one party to another.

What is Solidity?

Solidity is a programming language for writing Smart Contracts.  Essentially, think of it as a way to control a bank account with code.  With Solidity, we can write applications that simulate a crowd funding campaign, a lottery, a loan, or any other type of financial instrument.  Don't be intimidated by learning 'another' programming language; Solidity is known to be quite similar to Javascript and exceptionally easy to pick up for anyone who has previous JS experience.  This course will give you all the tools you need to master Solidity.

This course crams months of computer science and interview prep material into 20 hours of video. The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person coding bootcamps, where my students go on to land 6-figure developer jobs. I cover the exact same computer science content that has helped my students ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook. Nothing is watered down for an online audience; this is the real deal :)   We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. 

I start by teaching you how to analyze your code’s time and space complexity using Big O notation.  We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.  The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.

Here's why this course is worth your time:

It's interactive -  I give you a chance to try every problem before I show you my solution.

Every single problem has a complete solution walkthrough video as well as accompanying solution file.

I cover helpful ""tips and tricks"" to solve common problems, but we also focus on building an approach to ANY problem.

A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips
Learning the fundamentals of HTML5 & CSS3 puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. HTML & CSS are free, easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for all things on the web. .

When I am asked: Where should I start if I want to learn programming? My response is always HTML and CSS. Have you ever wanted to dive further into Wordpress themes? Have you ever wanted to create a beautiful HTML email? Or maybe you just want to be able to design websites. This course is the place to start.

Content and Overview

Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 56 lectures and 6 hours of content, you’ll start by downloading a text editor and coding in HTML. Random lectures have specific ""challenges"" sprinkled in.

After creating some basic web pages and learning about HTML syntax we will go over the differences and changes in HTML 5.(Todays standard)

With the basics of HTML established, we will begin to dive into the world of cascading style sheets.(CSS) We can supercharge our learning by tackling both at the same time.

Finally, we take the course into ""project mode."" We will go step by step, line by line, and code our own modern and beautiful website using CSS3 and HTML5.




This course was created to establish a foundation in programming by learning HTML5 and CSS3. These are the building blocks of all websites.


This course is targeted towards teaching every day people to code, not just computer science majors.

-

Docker & Kubernetes are amongst the most in-demand technologies and topics you can learn these days.

Why?

Because they significantly simplify the development and deployment process of both simple and complex software projects. Especially in web development (though not limited to that), Docker can really take you to the next level!

With Docker, you create and manage so-called ""Containers"" - basically packages of code and tools required to run that code. These containers allow you to run your programs in a predictable, environment-independent way - no matter where you need to run it.

For modern DevOps (Development Operations) but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a winner feature since you will no longer have any ""but it worked on my machine"" discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!

This course will teach you both Docker & Kubernetes from the ground up with all the required theory and tons of examples and demos!

We'll explore all key concepts in detail and with practical examples and demos - from images and containers, over volumes and networking all the way up to deployment and Kubernetes Cluster: This course has it all!

In detail, this course includes the following topics:

A thorough introduction to Docker, containers and why you might want to use Docker

Detailed setup instructions for macOS and Windows

A deep-dive into the core concepts you need to know: Containers & images

Learn how to create custom images, use existing images and how to run containers based on such images

Get a detailed overview of the core commands you need when working with Docker

Learn how to work with data and how to persist data with volumes

Explore container networking - with the outside world and between multiple containers

Learn how to work with both single and multi-container projects

In-depth deployment instructions: Manual deployment and deployment with managed services like AWS ECS

Understand Kubernetes core concepts & architecture

Learn how to create Kubernetes resources, deployments, services and how to run your containers with Kubernetes

Dive deeply into working with data in Kubernetes projects - with different types of volumes

Kubernetes networking and DNS service discovery

Learn how to deploy your Kubernetes project (at the example of AWS EKS)

And much more!

All these topics are taught in great detail with slides and theory but also, most importantly, with many examples and demo!

You'll find tons of demo projects throughout the course - using programming languages like NodeJS, Python or PHP (with Laravel). You don't need to know these languages to follow along though, no worries!",Steve B.

Learn how to create modern, scalable and high-speed web applications with Angular + Node.js + Express + MongoDB.

Angular 1 and NodeJS, together with ExpressJS (a NodeJS Framework) and MongoDB formed the very popular MEAN stack. Now is the time to dive into MEAN 2.0 and replace Angular 1 with Angular 2+.

Benefit from the many improvements and advantages Angular offers you: Speed, ease of development, highly reactive, awesome support for asynchronous operations, great scalability and more!
And combine these advantages with the power of a NodeJS + Express + MongoDB backend!

Learn or refresh the Angular Basics!

This course is no Angular course, but it includes detailed explanations of the core concepts used as well as about Angular in general. However, keep in mind that, as this course is no Angular course, having additional resources like my ""Angular - The Complete Guide"" course is recommended.

I'm Maximilian Schwarzmüller, an experienced web developer as well as author of many 5-star rated Udemy courses and host of the ""Academind"" coding channel on YouTube. I will take you on a hands-on journey to get you to build your own Angular + NodeJS Applications in no time!

This course follows a hands-on approach, which means that the whole course is structured around one big application and the different concepts will be explained detailedly as they are introduced in this application.

Specifically, you will learn how to:

Set up a NodeJS + Express + MongoDB + Angular Application with the help of the Angular CLI

Use NodeJS and Express efficiently

Build reusable Components in Angular and create a reactive User Experience with the Tools provided by Angular

Connect your NodeJS (or any other language!) backend with your Angular App through Angular’s HttpClient service

Provide appropriate endpoints on your Backend, for your Frontend to consume

Add advanced features like file upload and pagination

Make your Application more secure by implementing Users, Authentication as well as Authorization

Handle Errors gracefully

And much more!

This hands-on concept allows you to not get stuck in the theory, but instantly see real implementation examples!

Hear what students of other courses as well as viewers of my YouTube channel have to say

Max has gone through great lengths to create great content and this course has been great. His teaching style covers everything from basic to advanced topics, and his explanations have been thorough on each topic

Max demonstrates very good knowledge of the subject matter and great enthusiasm in delivering the lectures.

Max does a wonderful job making the core concepts of Angular approachable and accessible.

Don’t stop at the basics!

Do you know those courses which show you a ""Hello World“ example and then call it an end? That won’t happen to you in this course. While beginning with a very basic app and basic features, you will quickly be able to incorporate many different Routes, Observables, Events, Authentication and Authorization, Error Handling and much more into your applications.
The best thing is: You’ll learn all that by putting it into practice immediately! No wall of powerpoint slides, no unrealistic mini-examples – this is the real deal!

Who should take this course?

Basic NodeJS/Express and Angular Experience is strongly recommended

You should be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics, too

MongoDB (+ Mongoose) knowledge is a plus as MongoDB will be used in this course but won’t be subject of in-depth explanations

NO expert or advanced knowledge on any of these topics is required or assumed

By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own, awesome NodeJS + Angular applications!",Constantine F.

CRUD Operations, Indexes, Aggregation Framework - All about MongoDB!",Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller,4.7,English,Last updated 1/2024,"Join this bestselling MongoDB course to learn all about this extremely popular database and query language from the ground up, in great detail and with many practical examples!

-

MongoDB is one of the most important NoSQL databases you can work with. It's extremely popular and MongoDB developers are in high demand!

No matter if you're building web applications, mobile applications or any other kind of application or if you're a data scientist - you'll need to work with data. Storing data, querying it efficiently and minimizing complexities whilst optimizing performance are crucial tasks.

MongoDB makes working with data simple - it's built on a philosophy that prioritizes performance and efficiency.

In this course, you learn all about MongoDB from scratch. No prior MongoDB or database experience is required!

In detail, you'll learn:

How to install and use MongoDB locally and in the cloud (MongoDB Atlas)

How to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB databases

How to filter for data efficiently

How to work with both the Mongo Shell and drivers (e.g. Node.js driver)

How to increase performance by using indexes (and how to use the right indexes!)

How to use the amazing ""Aggregation Framework"" that's built into MongoDB

What replica sets and sharding are

How to use MongoDB Atlas - the cloud solution offered by MongoDB

How to use the serverless platform (Stitch) offered by MongoDB

And much more!

This course is a hands-on course - you'll learn by writing code/ commands. We'll work on a wide variety of example data and use-cases and by the end of the course, you'll have all the knowledge you need to work with MongoDB in your next project!

This course is for you, no matter which programming language you plan on using, you'll learn a uniform way of interacting with MongoDB that can be easily applied to any language.

This course is for you:

if you're brand-new to MongoDB and databases in general

if you got some basic database or even MongoDB experience - in this course, there are different entry points you can choose from!

if you are a web or mobile app (or desktop app) developer who considers using MongoDB

if you're working in a team that considers using MongoDB (or already does use it)

if you are primarily using SQL-based databases so far and you want to explore the most popular NoSQL alternative

This course is NOT for you:

if you're looking for a guide on administrating MongoDB servers => This course focuses on the commands/ queries you write, it's NOT an administration course. I will show (in detail) how to deploy a ready-to-use cloud MongoDB solution that follows best practices though.",Lidwin L.

Have you tried to learn React before?

It’s easy to go down the rabbit hole of libraries and tools only to come out of it not knowing how to build and launch a real-world React application. You get things configured, but you’re not sure how the libraries fit together (or if you’re even using the right one).

Sound familiar?

I built this course to show you how you can build and launch real-world React web applications.

The Complete React Web Developer Course 2 starts with the fundamentals and covers everything you’ll need to build and launch React web apps.

You’ll see what it takes to build and launch a React app, from the first line of code to the final production deployment.

This course was designed around one goal: turning you into a professional React developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.

You’ll learn React by doing, not watching.

From the first videos you’ll be building out each project as well as completing programming challenges I’ve designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.

Throughout the course you’ll build two React web apps:

The first app, a decision-making app called Indecision, is our starter application. You’ll learn the fundamentals of React while seeing exactly what it takes to get a React app up and running.

The second app, an expense manager called Budget, has all the features you’d expect from a real application. You’ll set up authentication, user accounts, routing, testing, form validation, database storage, and more.

Stay up-to-date in an ever changing world.

The world of React changes fast, and that’s why I’m always working to keep this course as up-to-date as possible. You can jump in knowing you’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.

Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.

There’s no need to worry if you’re learning the right skills to land that React job or launch that React app. I’ve mapped out everything you need to know in an interactive easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a couple of weeks.

There’s no better time to learn React.

React’s not going anywhere. Companies like Facebook, Walmart, Uber, Airbnb, and Netflix are all using React in production right now.

They’ve also made heavy investments in the React ecosystem, creating new libraries and tools that speed up and simplify React development. From the biggest to the smallest, everyone’s using React and new jobs are popping up every day.

Get access to fast support if you get stuck.

There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question.

I’ll work with you to get you unstuck and back on track. It’s one of the reasons students love taking my courses:

“This is the absolute best course I've taken on udemy. Andrew is amazing at explaining things concisely, and the flow of the course is perfect. He doesn't skip over anything and he doesn't over-explain anything. On top of all that, he responds to questions so quickly that you won't be stuck at any point."" - Tanya Gamarian

""The lessons are of high quality and even more important, he actually takes time to answer your questions!"" - Thomas Vercamer

""The instructor does an excellent job in explaining how to build React Apps. He also responds quickly to any questions that are asked."" - Matt Willy

Fortunately, the second best time is today!  Git is an essential tool for work in any code-related field, from data science to game development to machine learning.  This course covers everything you need to know to start using Git and Github in the real-world today!

The course's 20+ sections are broken down into four separate units:

Git Essentials

Next Level Git

Github & Collaboration

The Tricky Bits

We start off with Git Essentials.  The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.  We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.  Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).  The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like committing and branching and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.    We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.  We end with a detailed look at branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

Then we move on to out Next Level Git unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as ""core"" as the Git Essentials.  We start with a comprehensive look at the gif diff command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!  We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.  Then we shift our focus to stashing with the git stash command, a ""convenience command"" that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.  Finally, we dive deep into undoing changes and time traveling with Git.  We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.  We cover git commands that help us undo changes including git checkout, git restore, git reset, and git revert.

Next up, we change gears to focus on Github & Collaboration.  We start by exploring Github (and similar tools) that host remote repositories and discussing the benefits they provide.  We create our own Github repositories and sync up changes between our remote and local repositories using the git push, git pull, and git fetch commands.  We then focus on commonly used collaboration workflows that students may encounter in the real world: feature branching, pull requests, forking & cloning, and more! We discuss contributing to open source projects and configuring Github repositories for collaboration. We also spend some time learning about useful Github features including Github Gists and Github Pages for free static hosting.

The last unit in the course, The Tricky Bits, is really just a collection of useful Git command and advanced topics.  We start by covering one of the ""scarier"" Git commands: rebasing!  We discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rebasing and compare it to merging.  Then we learn how to clean up our Git history by rewording, editing, dropping, and squashing commits using the interactive rebase command.  Next, we discuss Git tags (lightweight and annotated tags) semantic versioning and tagging workflows.  After that, we move on to a deep dive into the inner workings of Git.  We discuss the files and folders Git uses internally, the role of hashing functions in Git, and the role of Git objects (blobs, trees, etc.). Next, we talk about reference logs and the git reflog command.  Specifically, we learn how we can use reflogs to rescue ""lost"" commits and undo rebases.  Finally, we learn how to write custom and powerful Git aliases!

Throughout the course, you'll find tons and tons of diagrams and visual references I've created to try and explain Git.  The course also includes exercises I've tested on my in-person students, to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts in the course along the way.  If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you on making it this far :) I hope you enjoy the course!",Benjamin V.

Special Note for College Students: Lecture three provides dedicated guidance with weekly and semester goals, integrating smoothly into your college schedule.




Course Specifics:

This course begins by giving a birds-eye view of Java covering everything from origin of Java to installing Java and writing your first Java program. Even the most fundamental concepts like compilation & interpretation are explained. All other topics are covered in-depth starting from language basics, object-oriented concepts & design, JVM internals, exceptions, IO, collections framework, generics, multi-threading, databases, nested classes, enums, and functional-style programming via Java 8 constructs like lambdas & streams. You'll also learn about database designing, implementation (SQL), and how to interact with them from Java programs (via JDBC). The course also gives a very good introduction to Java EE technologies like Servlets & JSTL, which help in project implementation. Finally, an excellent Eclipse IDE tutorial is also included, which teaches you how to use Eclipse professionally for effectively writing, debugging and even testing Java programs using the JUnit framework.

Each lecture has been very carefully crafted explaining the motivation behind every concept. Each concept is clearly explained with well thought out examples & illustrations and is demonstrated in code. Object-oriented concepts like inheritance & polymorphism are explained through a real-world case-study, which is also implemented as part of the course project. Several challenging coding exercises & quizzes are included to reinforce what you've learned.

The course project involves building a bookmarking Web application that helps users bookmark items like Books, Movies, and Web pages and is built progressively as new concepts are learned. The project is instructor-led and is implemented using professional coding conventions & best practices. It follows good object-oriented design, incorporates MVC architectural pattern and also uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Java EE stack comprising technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSTL are used for building the application with MySQL as the database and Apache Tomcat as the Web server. Parts of the project use advanced multi-threading capabilities.

Finally, course also teaches several best practices & design principles that are essential for writing well-designed code. This is one of the highlights of the course and will make you truly complete!




Story behind Creating this Course:

The idea for building this Master Course has taken its roots during the instructor's (Dheeru Munduru) experience as a software engineer in Silicon Valley. After working for several years with many excellent engineers, Dheeru realized that sometimes the teams he worked with fell short of developing effective solutions. This led to several rounds of ""code refactoring"" resulting in loss of valuable time for the organization. This he realized was due to programming not being taught in the right way at most Universities & Colleges across the world. Students are mostly taught only core programming language features without any emphasis on best practices or design rules required for writing well-designed, professional-level code. Due to this, developers are often ill-equipped when they have to come up with good solutions for complex problems. This leads to some quick ad-hoc & incomplete learning, which often not only result in bad solutions, but also more importantly causes lot of stress on developer's part. This made Dheeru realize that a more holistic approach to teaching is needed where programming language features are taught along with best practices & design principles needed for building well-designed robust software. This course is a result of this realization and it has taken him over 6 years of full-time effort (considered equivalent to over a decade if working part-time) in developing it. He will continue to devote himself in building this course towards making it one of the best Java courses out there."

Have you learnt the basics of ASP.NET Core and Angular?  Not sure where to go next?  This course should be able to help with that.  In this course we start from nothing and incrementally build up our API and Angular front end until we have a fully functional Web Application that we then publish to IIS and a Linux server.

These are 2 of the hottest frameworks right now for the 'back-end' (Microsoft's ASP.NET Core) and the 'front-end' (Google's Angular) and are well worth spending the time to learn.

In this course we build a complete application from start to finish and every line of code is demonstrated and explained.


This course is right up to date as at November 2022 using .Net 7.0 and Angular v14 and as these frameworks evolve, this course will evolve with it.  

Read some of the great reviews of the course:

Jim says ""The absolute best course for building an API in .Net core and working with Angular!""

Daniyal says: ""This is a complete project based course from start to finish with real world experience using technologies that are currently in demand in the market. People interested in learning latest technologies should consider this course.""

Here are some of the things you will learn about in this course:

Setting up the developer environment

Creating the ASP.NET Core WebAPI and the Angular app using the DotNet CLI and the Angular CLI

Adding a Client side login and register function to our Angular application

Adding 3rd party components to add some pizzazz to the app

Adding routing to the Angular application and securing routes.

Using Automapper in ASP.NET Core

Building a great looking UI using Bootstrap

Adding Photo Upload functionality as well as a cool looking gallery in Angular

Angular Template forms and Reactive forms and validation

Paging, Sorting and Filtering

Adding a Private Messaging system to the app

Publishing the application to Heroku free of charge

Using SignalR for real time presence and live messaging between users

Many more things as well

Tools you need for this course

In this course all the lessons are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code, a free (and fantastic) cross platform code editor.   You can of course use any code editor you like and any Operating system you like... as long as it's Windows, Linux or Mac


Is this course for you?

This course is very practical, about 90%+ of the lessons will involve you coding along with me on this project.  If you are the type of person who gets the most out of learning by doing, then this course is definitely for you.  


On this course we will build an example Dating Application, completely from scratch using the DotNet CLI and the Angular CLI to help us get started.  All you will need to get started is a computer with your favourite operating system, and a passion for learning how to build an application using ASP.NET Core and Angular.  ",Darko G.

Would you like to become a more complete and in-demand developer?

Then Node.js is the hot technology for you to learn right now, and you came to the right place to do it!

Welcome to the Complete Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Bootcamp, your fast track to modern back-end development.

This course is the perfect all-in-one package that will take you from a complete beginner to an advanced, highly-skilled Node.js developer.

Like all my other courses, this one is completely project-based! And not just any project: it's a complete, beautiful, and feature-rich application, containing both a RESTful API and a server-side rendered website. It's the most fantastic and complete project that you will find in any Node.js course on the internet!

By building this huge project, you will learn all the skills that you need in order to plan, build, and deploy your own modern back-end applications with Node.js and related technologies.

(If you feel like exploring the project, you can do so at www[.]natours[.]dev. And this is only a small part of the project! Log in with ""laura@example.com"" and password ""test1234"")




After finishing this course, you will:

1) Be building your own fast, scalable, and powerful Node.js RESTful APIs or web applications;

2) Truly understand how Node.js works behind the scenes;

3) Be able to work with NoSQL data and model data in real-world situations (a hugely important skill);

4) Know how modern back-end development works, and how all the different technologies fit together (hard to understand from scattered tutorials and videos);

5) Have experience in professionally used tools and libraries like Express, Mongoose, Stripe, Sendgrid, Atlas, Compass, Git, Heroku, and many more;

6) Have built a complete application, which is a perfect starting point for your own applications in the future.

Please note that this course is NOT for absolute web development beginners, so you should already be familiar with basic JavaScript. NO back-end experience required though!




It's an absolutely full-packed, deep-dive course with over 40 hours of content!

Since this is the ""Complete Node.js Bootcamp"", the course is crammed with tons of different technologies, techniques, and tools, so that you walk away from the course as a complete Node.js developer.

That's why the course turned out to be over 40 hours long. But if that sounds like too much for you, don't worry, there are videos or entire sections that you can safely skip.

Here is exactly what you're gonna learn:

Fundamentals of Node.js, core modules, and NPM (Node Package Manager)

How Node.js works behind the scenes: event loop, blocking vs non-blocking code, event-driven architecture, streams, modules, etc.

Fundamentals of Express (Node.js framework): routing, middleware, sending responses, etc.

RESTful API design and development with advanced features: filtering, sorting, aliasing, pagination

Server-side website rendering (HTML) with Pug templates

CRUD operations with MongoDB database locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud)

Advanced MongoDB: geospatial queries, aggregation pipeline, and operators

Fundamentals of Mongoose (MongoDB JS driver): Data models, CRUD operations, data validation, and middleware

Advanced Mongoose features: modeling geospatial data, populates, virtual populates, indexes, etc.

Using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture

How to work with data in NoSQL databases

Advanced data modelling: relationships between data, embedding, referencing, and more

Complete modern authentication with JWT: user sign up, log in, password reset, secure cookies, etc.

Authorization (user roles)

Security: best practices, encryption, sanitization, rate limiting, etc.

Accepting credit card payments with Stripe: Complete integration on the back-end and front-end

Uploading files and image processing

Sending emails with Mailtrap and Sendgrid

Advanced error handling workflows

Deploying Node.js application to production with Heroku

Git and GitHub crash course

And so much more!




Why should you learn Node.js and take this course?

If you want to learn Node.js and modern back-end development, then there is no doubt that this course is for you!

It's the biggest Node.js course on the internet, it has by far the most complete course project, and offers the most in-depth explanations of all topics included.

And even if you already know some Node.js, you should still take this course, because it contains subjects that are not covered anywhere else, or not in the same depth!

But maybe you're not yet convinced that Node.js really is the right technology for you to learn right now?

Well, first, Node.js will allow you to use your JavaScript skills to build applications on the back-end. That itself is a huge gain, which makes your full-stack development process so much easier and faster.

Plus, popularity and opportunities for Node.js are off the charts. It's a modern, proven, and reliable technology, used by tech giants (and 6-figure-salary-paying companies) like Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and many more.

Node.js really is what you should invest your time in, instead of outdated technology like PHP.

In summary, if you already know JavaScript, learning Node is the logical next step for you! It will make you a better, more versatile, and more complete developer, which will ultimately boost your opportunities in the job market!

And I created this course to help you do exactly that! It really is the course I wish I had when I was first learning back-end development with Node.js and all related technologies.

""I’ve actually landed my first job as a Junior software developer. I owe a lot of it to you because your courses have been EXTREMELY helpful. May God bless you and your efforts to create high quality courses. This has really changed my life from working as a security guard and doing websites for free, now I am a professional."" -Danish Jafri





""Just finished this course today, it was absolutely brilliant! They way the course boils down huge topics, that would take hundreds of dry boring text books into short videos, while including not only theory but how professionals make the most of the concepts. The Man has serious passion about Development, his enthusiasm and experience really make these dense topics fun & easy to learn!"" -Conor McGarth




""This guy really knows what he is doing. I have been a developer for a while and he really knows how to break down what happens behind the scenes and how to create code that is extensible and reusable. I had peers telling me that paying for a course is not worth it but I went ahead and did it and I have learned so much from the videos. This course is definitely worth the price."" -Justin Weinzimmer

""Mosh is a great teacher, explains things clearly, his lessons have a nice logical order, the course is engaging, he never bores, he DOES answer every single question. Highly recommended!"" -Frantisek Nagy




""Excellent! Another brilliant piece of instruction... I have grown to expect nothing less from Mosh!"" -Douglas Crowder




""One of my favorite aspects of Mosh's teaching style is his effort to retain relevance to real-world situations. As an experienced C# developer myself, I can tell you pretty much every topic in this course is important to a .Net developer, and Mosh does a good job of separating what you should understand conceptually versus how you'll likely be using the concepts in practice."" -M.B




""The information that Mosh provides is extremely helpful. He does a great job of explaining things. Mosh has an interesting and fun style of presenting information. He covers the topics thoroughly and responds to questions in the discussions."" -Jon Ownbey

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

Go is an amazing choice for a language as it was developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8 - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax.

Go was created by luminaries in computer science at one of the best, if not the very best, software engineering firm to have ever existed - Google.

The credentials of Go are unsurpassed.

But why did Google create a new language?

In Google’s words, “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming; all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.”

In my opinion, Go is the best programming language that you can be learning today. I began programming in 1982 with BASIC, I have worked with many languages, and Go is the best language which I have ever used. Go is also the top-paid programming language in America today.

Come learn about the greatest programming language ever created. You will leave with resources and code samples to start making all of your software and apps really go.",karamveer H.

I say no more to copy-pasting code that you don’t understand.

Welcome to the bestselling REST API course on Udemy! I'm Jose. I'm a software engineer, here to help you truly understand and develop your skills in web and REST API development with Python, Flask, and Docker.


Production-ready REST APIs with Flask

This course will guide you in creating simple, intermediate, and advanced REST APIs including authentication, deployments, databases, and much more.

We'll start with a Python refresher that will take you from the very basics to some of the most advanced features of Python—that's all the Python you need to complete the course.

Using Flask and popular extensions Flask-Smorest, Flask-JWT-Extended, and Flask-SQLAlchemy we will dive right into developing complete, solid, production-ready REST APIs.

We will also look into essential technologies like Git and database migrations with Alembic.




You'll be able to...

Create resource-based, production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, and popular Flask extensions;

Handle secure user registration and authentication with Flask.

Using SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy to easily and efficiently store resources to a database; and

Understand the complex intricacies of deployments of Flask REST APIs.

Use Docker to simplify running and deploying your REST APIs.




But what is a REST API anyway?

A REST API is an application that accepts data from clients and returns data back. For example, a REST API could accept text data from the client, such as a username and password, and return whether that is a valid user in the database.

When developing REST APIs, our clients are usually web apps or mobile apps. That's in contrast to when we make websites, where the clients are usually the users themselves.

Together we'll develop a REST API that not only allows clients to authenticate but also to store and retrieve any data you want from a database. Learning this will help you develop any REST API that you need for your own projects!




I pride myself on providing excellent support and feedback to every single student. I am always available to guide you and answer your questions.

I'll see you on the inside. Take your first step towards REST API mastery!"

This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build AngularJS applications - and we'll build a single page application along the way.   We'll design custom services, build custom directives, understand two-way binding, design a weather forecast app as a single page application, and lots more.

To learn AngularJS you have to understand it.   I've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning AngularJS. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.   In this course you will:   Learn how AngularJS works, covering subjects like directives, dependency injection, two way data binding, the digest loop, watchers, and more. Learn fundamental Javascript and HTML principles that are used by AngularJS, such as custom attributes, loosely typed arrays, the hash, and the event loop. Code custom services. Design custom directives, understanding concepts like compile, link, and scope. Build a single page application using AngularJS. Keep up with the latest on the next version of AngularJS 2.0!   AngularJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.   I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand AngularJS.   Note: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.",Mariam N.

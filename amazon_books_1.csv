                 More           ","The essential manual on generating consistent returns from the Indian stock market by Saurabh Mukherjea, the bestselling author of Coffee Can Investing and The Unusual Billionaires.

Over the last few years, there has been a growing realization among Indians that their life's savings, the bulk of which are parked in physical assets like real estate and gold, are unlikely to help them generate sufficient returns to fund their financial goals, including retirement. At the same time, many have lost their hard-earned money trying to invest in financial assets, including debt and equities. Such losses have occurred due to many reasons, such as corporate frauds, weak business models and misallocation of capital by the companies in whose shares unsuspecting investors parked their savings. What options do Indian savers then have to invest in, and build their wealth?

Diamonds in the Dust offers Indian savers a simple, yet highly effective, investment technique to identify clean, well-managed Indian companies that have consistently generated outsized returns for investors. Based on in-depth research conducted by the award-winning team at Marcellus Investment Managers, it uses case studies and charts to help readers learn the art and science of investing in the US$3 trillion Indian stock market.

The book also debunks many notions of investing that have emerged from the misguided application of Western investment theories in the Indian context.

Vital and indispensable, this book will serve as the ultimate manual on investing and provide practical counsel to readers to achieve their financial goals."," <p><span class=""a-text-bold"">The essential manual on generating consistent returns from the Indian stock market by Saurabh Mukherjea, the bestselling author of </span><span class=""a-text-bold a-text-italic"">Coffee Can Investing</span><span class=""a-text-bold""> and </span><span class=""a-text-bold a-text-italic"">The Unusual Billionaires</span><span class=""a-text-bold"">.</span><span><br><br>Over the last few years, there has been a growing realization among Indians that their life's savings, the bulk of which are parked in physical assets like real estate and gold, are unlikely to help them generate sufficient returns to fund their financial goals, including retirement.

This is not a romance, but it is about love

Two kids meet in a hospital gaming room in 1987. One is visiting her sister, the other is recovering from a car crash. The days and months are long there. Their love of video games becomes a shared world -- of joy, escape and fierce competition. But all too soon that time is over, fades from view.

When the pair spot each other eight years later in a crowded train station, they are catapulted back to that moment. The spark is immediate, and together they get to work on what they love - making games to delight, challenge and immerse players, finding an intimacy in digital worlds that eludes them in their real lives. Their collaborations make them superstars.

This is the story of the perfect worlds Sadie and Sam build, the imperfect world they live in, and of everything that comes after success: Money. Fame. Duplicity. Tragedy.

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow takes us on a dazzling imaginative quest as it examines the nature of identity, creativity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play and, above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love.

Today, software engineers need to know not only how to program effectively but also how to develop proper engineering practices to make their codebase sustainable and healthy. This book emphasizes this difference between programming and software engineering.

How can software engineers manage a living codebase that evolves and responds to changing requirements and demands over the length of its life? Based on their experience at Google, software engineers Titus Winters and Hyrum Wright, along with technical writer Tom Manshreck, present a candid and insightful look at how some of the world’s leading practitioners construct and maintain software. This book covers Google’s unique engineering culture, processes, and tools and how these aspects contribute to the effectiveness of an engineering organization.

You’ll explore three fundamental principles that software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, writing, and maintaining code:

How time affects the sustainability of software and how to make your code resilient over time
How scale affects the viability of software practices within an engineering organization
What trade-offs a typical engineer needs to make when evaluating design and development decisions"," <p><span class=""a-text-bold"">Newly adapted for audiobook listeners.</span></p><p><span>Today, software engineers need to know not only how to program effectively but also how to develop proper engineering practices to make their codebase sustainable and healthy.

'Captivating' New York Times book review

Jim Simons is the greatest moneymaker in modern financial history. His record bests those of legendary investors, including Warren Buffett, George Soros and Ray Dalio. Yet Simons and his strategies are shrouded in mystery. The financial industry has long craved a look inside Simons's secretive hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies and veteran Wall Street Journal reporter Gregory Zuckerman delivers the goods.

After a legendary career as a mathematician and a stint breaking Soviet codes, Simons set out to conquer financial markets with a radical approach. Simons hired physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists - most of whom knew little about finance - to amass piles of data and build algorithms hunting for the deeply hidden patterns in global markets. Experts scoffed, but Simons and his colleagues became some of the richest in the world, their strategy of creating mathematical models and crunching data embraced by almost every industry today.

As Renaissance became a major player in the financial world, its executives began exerting influence on other areas. Simons became a major force in scientific research, education and Democratic politics, funding Hilary Clinton's presidential campaign. While senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency - he placed Steve Bannon in the campaign, funded Trump's victorious 2016 effort and backed alt-right publication Breitbart. Mercer also impacted the success of the Brexit campaign as he made significant investments in Cambridge Anatlytica. For all his prescience, Simons failed to anticipate how Mercer's activity would impact his firm and the world.

In this fast-paced narrative, Zuckerman examines how Simons launched a quantitative revolution on Wall Street, and reveals the impact that Simons, the quiet billionaire king of the quants, has had on worlds well beyond finance."," <p><span class=""a-text-bold"">SHORTLISTED FOR THE FT AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD 2019</span><span><br><br></span><span class=""a-text-bold a-text-italic"">NEW YORK TIMES </span><span class=""a-text-bold"">AND </span><span class=""a-text-bold a-text-italic"">SUNDAY TIMES </span><span class=""a-text-bold"">BUSINESS BESTSELLER</span><span><br><br> 'Reads more like a delicious page-turning novel...Put it on your holiday gift list for your favourite hedge-fund honcho' </span><span class=""a-text-italic"">Bloomberg</span><span><br><br>'A compelling read' </span><span class=""a-text-italic"">Economist</span><span><br><br> 'Captivating' </span><span class=""a-text-italic"">New York Times </span><span>book review<br><br>Jim Simons is the greatest moneymaker in modern financial history.

Instead, there are many hard parts—difficult problems or issues with no best practices—that force you to choose among various compromises. With this book, you'll learn how to think critically about the trade-offs involved with distributed architectures.

Architecture veterans and practicing consultants Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage, and Zhamak Dehghani discuss strategies for choosing an appropriate architecture. By interweaving a story about a fictional group of technology professionals, they examine everything from how to determine service granularity, manage workflows and orchestration, manage and decouple contracts, and manage distributed transactions to how to optimize operational characteristics, such as scalability, elasticity, and performance.

This book provides techniques to help you discover and weigh the trade-offs as you confront the issues you face as an architect. You'll find out how to analyze trade-offs and effectively document your decisions; make better decisions regarding service granularity; understand the complexities of breaking apart monolithic applications; manage and decouple contracts between services; handle data in a highly distributed architecture; and learn patterns to manage workflow and transactions when breaking apart applications.

An understanding of psychology-specifically the psychology behind how users behave and interact with digital interfaces-is perhaps the single most valuable nondesign skill a designer can have. The most elegant design can fail if it forces users to conform to the design instead of working within the ""blueprint"" of how humans perceive and process the world around them.

This practical guide explains how you can apply key principles of psychology to build products and experiences that are more human-centered and intuitive. Author Jon Yablonski deconstructs familiar apps and experiences to provide clear examples of how UX designers can build interfaces that adapt to how users perceive and process digital interfaces.

You'll learn:

How aesthetically pleasing design creates positive responses
The principles of psychology most useful for designers
How these psychology principles relate to UX heuristics
Predictive models including Fitts's law, Jakob's law, and Hick's law
Ethical implications of using psychology in design
A practical framework for applying principles of psychology in your design process

This updated edition includes an even deeper connection to the underlying psychological concepts that govern the principles explored in the book, along with accompanying UX methods and techniques. Examples have been updated to ensure the deconstructed apps and experiences remain familiar and relevant."," <p><span class=""a-text-bold"">Disclaimer</span></p><p><span class=""a-text-bold"">Shroff Publishers do not endorse the preview pages of kindle linked to our ISBNs. </span></p><p><span>An understanding of psychology-specifically the psychology behind how users behave and interact with digital interfaces-is perhaps the single most valuable nondesign skill a designer can have.

It will take hard work, but you will thrive if you are willing to adapt and learn.

I am a software engineer who faced real interviews as a candidate for startups and big companies. Throughout the years, I have sourced factual questions that have been tried, tested, and commented on step by step and are now part of this book!. I hope you find them practical and useful in your career search.

Why are algorithms used in interviews?

Jobs in the tech industry are expected to grow exponentially in the next few years. If you plan to enter the job market soon, you must know that companies will evaluate your problem-solving skills based on data structures and algorithms, and you will need to face a complex problem on a blackboard.

That's the reason why Algorithms and Data structures are vital. You need this book because it includes the most common questions you can find in a real interview!.

By the end of reading this book, you'll be able to:

Understand the basics of common data structures and algorithms and apply them to real questions.
Apply clean code practices to develop a usable algorithm.
Understand the importance of text manipulation methods, lists, recursion, class design, queues, stacks, hashing, trees, graphs, and many more.
Develop a complete algorithm using the TDD approach, e.g., graph-based transport system, tic tac toe game.
React better than other candidates when faced with a new problem, e.g., design an algorithm to solve a problem you haven't seen before.
Understand and practice 40 code challenges explained step by step, including its pictorial representation.

How many hours' worth of songs are on your Spotify Wrapped this year?
How much is your commute time really worth?
How do you work out how likely you are to get Covid based on the official statistics?
How do your viewing hours track against the most popular shows on Netflix?

Whether you're interested in global problems like climate change, running a business, or just grasping how few people have washed their hands between visiting the bathroom and touching you, this book will help math-lovers and math-haters alike translate the numbers that illuminate our world.

Until very recently, most languages had no words for numbers greater than five - anything from six to infinity was known as 'lots'. While the numbers in our world have become increasingly complex, our brains are stuck in the past. Yet the ability to communicate and understand numbers has never mattered more. How can we more effectively translate numbers and stats - so fundamental to the next big idea - to make data come to life?

Drawing on years of research into making ideas stick, Chip Heath and Karla Starr outline six critical principles that will give anyone the tools to communicate numbers with more transparency and meaning. Using concepts such as simplicity, concreteness and familiarity, they show us how to transform hard numbers into their most engaging form, allowing us to bring more data, more naturally, into decisions in our schools, our workplaces and our society."," <p><span class=""a-text-bold"">A lively, practical, first-of-its-kind guide to understanding cold, clinical data and harnessing it to tell a persuasive story.<br></span><span class=""a-text-bold"">__________<br></span><span><br></span><span class=""a-text-bold"">How many hours' worth of songs are on your Spotify Wrapped this year?<br>How much is your commute time really worth?<br>How do you work out how likely you are to get Covid based on the official statistics?<br>How do your viewing hours track against the most popular shows on Netflix?</span><span><br><br>Whether you're interested in global problems like climate change, running a business, or just grasping how few people have washed their hands between visiting the bathroom and touching you, this book will help math-lovers and math-haters alike translate the numbers that illuminate our world.<br><br>Until very recently, most languages had no words for numbers greater than five - anything from six to infinity was known as 'lots'.

       	           ","Hacking is the art of creative problem solving, whether that means finding an unconventional solution to a difficult problem or exploiting holes in sloppy programming. Many people call themselves hackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to really push the envelope.

Rather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author Jon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work. To share the art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible to everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition introduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker's perspective.

The included LiveCD provides a complete Linux programming and debugging environment—all without modifying your current operating system. Use it to follow along with the book's examples as you fill gaps in your knowledge and explore hacking techniques on your own. Get your hands dirty debugging code, overflowing buffers, hijacking network communications, bypassing protections, exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, and perhaps even inventing new exploits. This book will teach you how to:
– Program computers using C, assembly language, and shell scripts
– Corrupt system memory to run arbitrary code using buffer overflows and format strings
– Inspect processor registers and system memory with a debugger to gain a real understanding of what is happening
– Outsmart common security measures like nonexecutable stacks and intrusion detection systems
– Gain access to a remote server using port-binding or connect-back shellcode, and alter a server's logging behavior to hide your presence
– Redirect network traffic, conceal open ports, and hijack TCP connections
– Crack encrypted wireless traffic using the FMS attack, and speed up brute-force attacks using a password probability matrix

Hackers are always pushing the boundaries, investigating the unknown, and evolving their art. Even if you don't already know how to program, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition will give you a complete picture of programming, machine architecture, network communications, and existing hacking techniques. Combine this knowledge with the included Linux environment, and all you need is your own creativity."," <span>Hacking is the art of creative problem solving, whether that means finding an unconventional solution to a difficult problem or exploiting holes in sloppy programming.

While this book is oriented towards Software Developers and Architects, this book can be helpful for any working in the High-Tech industry. In this, we will understand how popular products such as Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Dropbox, TinyURL, and Pastebin are designed. No prior technical knowledge is required before picking up this book.

Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. As a result, there is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis, systems architecture, and systems engineering. Designing software systems is a vast topic, and even a software engineer having years of experience at a top software company may not claim to be an expert on system design. Companies spend not weeks but months and hire a big team of software engineers to build such systems in real life.

As a Product Manager or Startup Founder, having a high-level understanding of the various technologies being used in you as well as popular products across the industry would be a handy tool in your toolkit. As a Venture Capitalist, you can better analyze the capabilities of the tech teams of the startups you are investing in as well as understand how their tech stands apart from the competition.

Even if you are not working directly in the Tech industry, everyone uses these products on a daily basis. Therefore, having an understanding of how these products work could help you improve your digital life and make use of these products in a better way."," <p><span>How do you design services like Instagram or Messenger, which have over 1 Billion users?

Early in his software developer career, John Sonmez discovered that technical knowledge alone isn't enough to break through to the next income level - developers need ""soft skills"" like the ability to learn new technologies just in time, communicate clearly with management and consulting clients, negotiate a fair hourly rate, and unite teammates and coworkers in working toward a common goal.

What you will learn in this book:

How to systematically find and fill the gaps in your technical knowledge so you can face any new challenge with confidence
Should you take contract work - or hold out for a salaried position? Which will earn you more, what the tradeoffs are, and how your personality should sway your choice
Should you learn JavaScript, C#, Python, C++? How to decide which programming language you should master first
Ever notice how every job ever posted requires ""3-5 years of experience,"" which you don't have? Simple solution for this frustrating chicken-and-egg problem that allows you to build legitimate job experience while you learn to code
Is earning a computer science degree a necessity - or a total waste of time? How to get a college degree with maximum credibility and minimum debt
Coding boot camps - some are great, some are complete scams. How to tell the difference so you don't find yourself cheated out of $10,000
Interviewer tells you, ""Dress code is casual around here - the development team wears flipflops."" What should you wear?
How do you deal with a boss who's a micromanager. Plus how helping your manager with his goals can make you the MVP of your team

Key Features
Write eloquent JavaScript and employ fundamental and advanced features to create your own web apps
Interact with the browser with HTML and JavaScript, and add dynamic images, shapes, and text with HTML5 Canvas
Build a password checker, paint web app, hangman game, and many more fun projects
Book Description

This book demonstrates the capabilities of JavaScript for web application development by combining theoretical learning with code exercises and fun projects that you can challenge yourself with. The guiding principle of the book is to show how straightforward JavaScript techniques can be used to make web apps ranging from dynamic websites to simple browser-based games.

JavaScript from Beginner to Professional focuses on key programming concepts and Document Object Model manipulations that are used to solve common problems in professional web applications. These include data validation, manipulating the appearance of web pages, working with asynchronous and concurrent code.

The book uses project-based learning to provide context for the theoretical components in a series of code examples that can be used as modules of an application, such as input validators, games, and simple animations. This will be supplemented with a brief crash course on HTML and CSS to illustrate how JavaScript components fit into a complete web application.

As you learn the concepts, you can try them in your own editor or browser console to get a solid understanding of how they work and what they do. By the end of this JavaScript book, you will feel confident writing core JavaScript code and be equipped to progress to more advanced libraries, frameworks, and environments such as React, Angular, and Node.js.

What you will learn
Use logic statements to make decisions within your code
Save time with JavaScript loops by avoiding writing the same code repeatedly
Use JavaScript functions and methods to selectively execute code
Connect to HTML5 elements and bring your own web pages to life with interactive content
Make your search patterns more effective with regular expressions
Explore concurrency and asynchronous programming to process events efficiently and improve performance
Get a head start on your next steps with primers on key libraries, frameworks, and APIs
Who this book is for

Linux for the Superuser

Unlike some operating systems, Linux doesn’t try to hide the important bits from you—it gives you full control of your computer. But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does.

In this third edition of the bestselling How Linux Works, author Brian Ward peels back the layers of this well-loved operating system to make Linux internals accessible. This edition has been thoroughly updated and expanded with added coverage of Logical Volume Manager (LVM), virtualization, and containers.

You'll learn:

How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init (systemd)
How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processes
How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers work
How development tools work and relate to shared libraries
How to write effective shell scripts

You’ll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user-space processes, including system calls, input and output, and filesystem maintenance. With its combination of background, theory, real-world examples, and thorough explanations, How Linux Works, 3rd Edition will teach you what you need to know to take control of your operating system.

Hands-on coverage of the LVM, journald logging system, and IPv6

This open access book enables C++ programmers to be at the forefront of this exciting and important new development that is helping to push computing to new levels. It is full of practical advice, detailed explanations, and code examples to illustrate key topics. 





Data parallelism in C++ enables access to parallel resources in a modern heterogeneous system, freeing you from being locked into any particular computing device. Now a single C++ application can use any combination of devices—including GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs and AI ASICs—that are suitable to the problems at hand.

This book begins by introducing data parallelism and foundational topics for effective use of the SYCL standard from the Khronos Group and Data Parallel C++ (DPC++), the open source compiler used in this book.  Later chapters cover advanced topics including error handling, hardware-specific programming, communication and synchronization, and memory model considerations.
Data Parallel C++ provides you with everything needed to use SYCL for programming heterogeneous systems.


What You'll Learn





Accelerate C++ programs using data-parallel programming
Target multiple device types (e.g. CPU, GPU, FPGA)
Use SYCL and SYCL compilers 
Connect with computing’s heterogeneous future via Intel’s oneAPI initiative

Who This Book Is For






Those new data-parallel programming and computer programmers interested in data-parallel programming using C++.
